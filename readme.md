# Blue's Discord bot

Working on making a simple Discord bot that will be able too, allow users to request roles,
As well as introduce them to the server, may continue to add more features but that is the goal for now.

## Installation

```bash
  mkdir DiscordBot
  python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py
```

### TODO:

1. Set-up listeners, that way the functions are added into the Bot's class, and not contained within it.

2. Set-up role selection.

3. Allow users to upload custom emotes?
